File handling in Python is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to perform a wide range of operations. However, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of file handling when writing Python programs, to ensure that the code is secure, reliable, and performs well.
Advantages of File Handling in Python
Versatility : File handling in Python allows you to perform a wide range of operations, such as creating, reading, writing, appending, renaming, and deleting files.
Flexibility : File handling in Python is highly flexible, as it allows you to work with different file types (e.g. text files, binary files, CSV files , etc.), and to perform different operations on files (e.g. read, write, append, etc.).

Python File Open
f = open(filename, mode)
r: open an existing file for a read operation.
w: open an existing file for a write operation. If the file already contains some data, then it will be overridden but if the file is not present then it creates the file as well.
a: open an existing file for append operation. It won’t override existing data.
r+: To read and write data into the file. This mode does not override the existing data, but you can modify the data starting from the beginning of the file.
w+: To write and read data. It overwrites the previous file if one exists, it will truncate the file to zero length or create a file if it does not exist.
a+: To append and read data from the file. It won’t override existing data.
